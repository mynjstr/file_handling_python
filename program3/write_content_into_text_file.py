#write many lines of content into a text file named mylife.txt.
#continue requesting additional lines until the person rejects.
continue = True
while continue:
    
#Ask for the user's input
#Insert a newline character at the line's end.
#Open mylife.txt file in append mode
#inquire the userÂ as to whether additional lines are needed.
# Break the inner loop if the user wishes to add additional lines.
## When the user is finished, break both loops and print a message.
# Produce a message indicating that the user's input is incorrect
